<h1>Caf√©s</h1>

<p>Caf√©s are my favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">"third place"</a>. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the gentle hum of people chatting, and the delicious pastries teasing you from behind the glass display. The soothing ambiance and lack of household distractions make cafes a cozy oasis of productivity. Plus, there's something oddly satisfying about setting up your laptop and joining the throngs of other people typing away on their own projects. Maybe it's the sense of camaraderie or the accountability of being surrounded by other motivated individuals. Whatever the reason, working from cafes is a joy that can't be beaten!</p>

<p>Over the years, I've explored a ton of cafes around the places I've lived but there are a select few that have become my go-to spots for productivity. This list is a curated collection of my favorite cafes, each with its unique charm and vibe. As I continue to travel and explore new places, I'll keep this list updated with fresh finds and hidden gems. For now, though, these cafes will always hold a special place in my heart! ü´∂</p>
