<h1>Books</h1>

<p style="text-align: center">ðŸ“– + ðŸ‘“ = ðŸ¤¯<p>

<p>Books have been the trusty sidekick in my quest for knowledge, always there to enlighten me and broaden my horizons. They have opened up countless doors for me, taking me on adventures to faraway lands and introducing me to new perspectives. Despite my love for books, there always seems to be too much to read and too little time. Over the years, I have lost my habit of reading regularly and this below tracker is a small step towards rebuilding a healthy reading habit! I feel that having a public tracker helps in being accountable and motivates to read more. I intend to keep this tracker updated on a weekly basis to document my reading journey.</p>

<p>Whether I'm reading for pleasure or to learn something new, I know that books will always be there for me, waiting to be explored! ðŸ™‚</p>
