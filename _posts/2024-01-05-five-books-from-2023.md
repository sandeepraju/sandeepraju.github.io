description: Books that I enjoyed reading in 2023!
---

In 2023, I unintentionally rediscovered a lost habit â€” the joy of reading. A habit that, in all honesty, was not part of any plan but unfolded organically throughout the year.

A few years ago, I thought it was time to up my reading game. I switched gears from breezy fiction to the serious stuff, thinking I was ready to "graduate" in my reading game. I wanted to be a bit of a book snob, only reading intellectual, hardcode, serious booksâ€¦ but guess what? That plan backfired. Instead of reading more, I found myself reading less. It felt like I never had time for reading anymore, and my highbrow book choices were making things worse, not better.

Then, one day in January last year, I couldn't find a physical copy of a book I wanted to read and had to resort to an audio book. Surprisingly, it changed everything. Suddenly, I was listening to all sorts of books. I was the kind of person who'd argue that listening to books was borderline sacrilege but there I was enjoying books while doing household chores, commuting to work, during workouts, and crazily enough, even when swimming (thanks to my trusted <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conduction-Headphones-Wireless-Open-Ear-Bluetooth/dp/B0CD1PGQ1L" target="_blank">bone conduction earphones</a>).

Slowly, over the year, I clocked in over [20 books]((/books)), defying my own expectations. Now, as we kick off 2024, I'm on a mission to continue this delightful habit. But hey, I'm not here to brag about numbers; I'm here to share a few special books that changed my perspective, challenged my thinking, and taught me a thing or two. So, here we goâ€¦



<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54898389-the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant" target="_blank">"The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" by Eric Jorgenson</a></h2>

This book is a captivating guide that transcends conventional wisdom, offering profound insights into both wealth and happiness. Expanding on Naval's famous tweetstorm ["How to get rich without getting lucky"](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?lang=en), this almanac serves as a map for navigating the complexities of life. It's a treasure trove of practical advice on self-discovery, generating wealth, and being happy. This book isn't just a guide; it's a roadmap to a more fulfilled and purposeful existence, making it a must-read for anyone seeking a holistic meaning of "success".

My favorite quote from this book:

>"A happy person isnâ€™t someone whoâ€™s happy all the time. Itâ€™s someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they donâ€™t lose their innate peace."

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens" target="_blank">"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari</a></h2>

Sapiens is an intellectual rollercoaster that takes readers on a journey through the vast landscape of human history. The author weaves a compelling narrative that explores our species' evolution from ancient ancestors to modern civilizations. The book challenges conventional beliefs, and has stirred [quite a few controversies](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/cwa4uv/how_accurate_is_the_book_sapiens_a_brief_history/). Rather than relying on this as a "fact-book" to expand my knowledge, it became a "thinking-book" helping me contemplate my understanding of the world. This thought-provoking masterpiece leaves a lasting impact on the way we perceive our own existence.

My favorite quote from this book:

>"There are no gods, no nations, no money, and no human rights, except in our collective imagination."

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22047640-zero-to-one" target="_blank">"Zero to One" by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters</a></h2>

"Zero to One" is a manifesto for entrepreneurs, urging them to innovate and create rather than imitate. The book delves into the philosophy of building a successful startup by emphasizing the value of uniqueness and monopolistic advantages. Thiel challenges conventional business wisdom, encouraging readers to think differently. One of the first contrarian questions in this book _"What truth do very few people agree with you on?"_ has been my go to conversation starter igniting pround conversations with friends, family, and colleagues. This book is a blueprint for anyone aiming to go beyond the ordinary rather than following existing norms.

My favorite quote from this book:

>"If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth."


<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4477.Complications" target="_blank">"Complications" by Atul Gawande</a></h2>

"Complications" offers a sneak peak at complexities inherent in the world of medicine. This was one book that opened my eyes on a field that I have very little knowledge on. Gawande, a skilled surgeon, takes readers on a journey through the challenges, dilemmas, and unexpected moments in the field of healthcare. The book delves into the intricate nature of medical decision-making, shedding light on the uncertainties that doctors face and the profound impact of their choices. It underscores the importance of a continuous improvement and the acknowledgment that mastery is an ongoing process. Gawande's reflections on the human element in complex systems resonate across disciplines â€’ I can see a lot of advice in this book being applicable to my day to day work in technology!

My favorite quote from this book:

>"Skill, [...] can be taught; tenacity cannot."

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me" target="_blank">"Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins</a></h2>

"Can't Hurt Me" was a great way for me to end the year. This book is about an extraordinary journey of resilience and self-discovery. David Goggins, a former Navy SEAL, shares his inspiring life story, pushing the boundaries of physical and mental endurance. Goggins' emphasizes on embracing discomfort and conquering adversity, making this book a powerful guide for anyone striving for personal transformation. This book is not just a memoir; it's a call to action to achieve greatness.

This book is filled with quotable lines page over page. Some of my favorite quotes from this book:

>"I don't stop when I'm tired. I stop when I'm done"

>"The most important conversations youâ€™ll ever have are the ones youâ€™ll have with yourself."

>"You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft, that you will die without ever realizing your true potential."

>"Denial is the ultimate comfort zone."
