Time flies - another year has gone by! Amidst life's hustle and bustle, I've once again found [solace in books](/books). This journey began unexpectedly a couple of years ago (like many other things in life) and has since become a consistent habit of finding time "in between life" to read. My wife is a champion of the "2-minute rule" - completing chores that take two minutes or less immediately, especially during small windows between bigger chores (I know, I know, chores between chores ðŸ« ). It never occurred to me that I could apply this to other things in life (such as learning or reading) until I stumbled upon Matthew Dicks' gem of a book, ["Someday is Today"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965575-someday-is-today). Dicks talks about the "in-between moments" - short periods between activities that are often wasted. Stealing these moments can make a meaningful difference in accomplishing things long-term. Having consistently used this technique for the past two years, I can confidently say that this small change has helped me read significantly more than I anticipated, despite my busy schedule.

This year, I was able to read over [20 books](/books) (again!), and just like [last year](/blog/five-books-from-2023/), I read some great ones (with a few [terrible ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58631680-negotiation-magic) as well). Continuing my yearly tradition of sharing some good books, here are five that inspired me, opened new perspectives, and challenged my thinking. I hope you find as much joy in reading them as I did, and that in sharing these, I'll find motivation to continue this journey, to keep turning pages and exploring worlds in the years to come...

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci" target="_blank">"Leonardo da Vinci" by Walter Isaacson</a></h2>

Walter Isaacson's "Leonardo da Vinci" takes us on a journey through the remarkable life of the Renaissance polymath, and how his insatiable curiosity shaped everything he touched. Through his detailed notebooks, paintings, and scientific studies, we see him seamlessly merge art and science. His curiosity was unmatched to the extent that you'd sometimes question "wait, why do I need to know that?" â€” here's an excerpt from his original (translated) notes referenced in the book:

><em>"The tongue of a woodpecker can extend more than three times the length of its bill. When not in use, it retracts into the skull and its cartilage-like structure continues past the jaw to wrap around the birdâ€™s head and then curve down to its nostril. In addition to digging out grubs from a tree, the long tongue protects the woodpeckerâ€™s brain. When the bird smashes its beak repeatedly into tree bark, the force exerted on its head is ten times what would kill a human. But its bizarre tongue and supporting structure act as a cushion, shielding the brain from shock"</em>

There is no reason you actually need to know any of this. It is information that has no real utility for your life, just as it had none for Leonardo â€” but he was driven by pure curiosity. Curiosity about anything and everything, which led him to discover, invent and build things nobody ever imagined before.

While his genius was undeniable, Leonardo was also the original master of the "I'll finish it later" approach - not from laziness, but because his mind constantly raced ahead to new discoveries and interests, leaving a trail of brilliant but incomplete works that reflected his perpetual search for perfection and understanding. So next time you're putting off a project, just remember - you're not procrastinating, you're being Leonardesque!

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air" target="_blank">"Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer</a></h2>

Though a bit dated, this book opened my eyes on the complexity of high altitude mountaineering, especially the elusive Mt. Everest. Jon Krakauer's "Into Thin Air" is a gripping firsthand account of the deadly 1996 Mount Everest disaster, where eight climbers lost their lives during one of the mountain's deadliest seasons. As a journalist, his writing is captivating yet full of lessons on the human's irrational urge to do impossible things, the ugly side of "commercial" climbing industry, and the brutal weather conditions mountaineers face. His narrative on how experienced guides made fateful decisions under oxygen-deprived minds at 29,000 feet, while paying clients pushed beyond their limits in pursuit of summit dreams is eye opening. I'd recommend this book for anyone who loves hiking, mountains, and wouldn't mind a lesson or two in true leadership.

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50208919-the-shiva-sutras" target="_blank">"The Shiva Sutras" by Ranjit Chaudhri</a></h2>

"The Shiva Sutras" by Ranjit Chaudhri explores the ancient Sanskrit text that forms a cornerstone of Kashmir Shaivism philosophy. A sutra is a Sanskrit word that literally means "thread" or "string," and in this context, it refers to an aphorism or a collection of aphorisms in the form of a manual or text. This spiritual manual talks about a path for self-realization through these aphorisms attributed to Lord Shiva himself. The interpretation of the aphorisms illuminate how consciousness evolves from limited individual awareness to universal consciousness. It's fascinating to read something that's thousands of years old yet relevant to the current day! The idea that â€” our true divine nature is already complete and perfect, it just needs to be discovered rather than created â€” is thought provoking, motivating, and pushes us to do (seek) more in all aspects of life!

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56769575-stiff" target="_blank">"Stiff" by Mary Roach</a></h2>

This was such an unexpectedly entertaining book that I read in 2024! Often, I try to pick books that teach me a thing or two about a field or industry that I have zero knowledge on â€” ["Complications" by Atul Gawande](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4477.Complications), ["Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens), or even the book I mentioned earlier ["Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air). This was one such book with fascinating and often humorous exploration of what happens to human bodies after death. Through engaging storytelling, Roach investigates the various ways cadavers contribute to scientific advancement and human knowledge. She takes us through various medical schools, forensic research facilities, and even decay research centers, revealing how donated bodies help train surgeons, improve car safety, and advance forensic science. Despite its macabre subject matter, the author does a great job at maintaining an entertaining tone throughout. This book not only taught me about the industry of dead bodies but a lot more on how to weave humor into your writing when discussing really serious topics!

<h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54505323-invent-and-wander" target="_blank">"Invent and Wander" by Jeff Bezos and Walter Isaacson</a></h2>

"Invent and Wander" is not a book technically, it's a collection of Jeff Bezos's annual letters to Amazon shareholders and other writings, curated by Walter Isaacson. The book provides a perspective into Bezos's business philosophy and Amazon's evolution from an online bookstore to a global powerhouse. Through his writings, Bezos shows us how to think big, and long-term. This book also has some quirky Amazon things like "Two way doors", "Six-page memos", "Silent reading meetings", and the concept of "Day 1 thinking". The latter part of this book was what fascinated me about how Bezos thinks â€” his reasons for starting Blue Origin and his acquisition of The Washington Post. This is a must read for anyone who wants to see the inner workings of Bezos' mind.
