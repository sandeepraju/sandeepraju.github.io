description: Curation of wise words that I strive to live by!
---

Over the years, I've developed a bit of a fascination with short, thought-provoking nuggets of wisdom â€” aphorisms, quotes, proverbs, maxims, adages, apothegms â€” whatever you call them. Thereâ€™s something captivating about how a few words can distill deep truths, sparking reflection or offering direction when life feels a bit unclear.

I often find myself revisiting these collected bits of wisdom when I need perspective, clarity, or even a little inspiration. Somehow, they transcend time and act like little beacons, showing up exactly when you need them most â€” whether youâ€™re lost in thought or just lost in general.

So, I've decided to curate them here, publicly. Think of this as a living document that I'll update whenever I stumble upon something new that speaks to me. A perpetual work-in-progress, much like life itself.

You might find some of these vague, and lacking context - that's intentional. I prefer to leave them as they are â€” short, mysterious, and open to interpretation. There's a certain magic in their brevity. I like that, depending on where you are in life or what youâ€™re going through, the same phrase can take on entirely different meanings.

So, here they are, in no specific order â€” take from them what you will. Theyâ€™ve helped guide me, and I hope, in some small way, they can do the same for you.
